Q: What is Open CV?
Ans: OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) is a powerful and widely-used library for computer vision and image processing tasks. It provides tools and functions to perform a variaty of task such as. 
1: Image and Video Processing (Reading, Writing, and displying images and videos)

Q: what is PyTorch?
    Opensource ML library, developed by Facebook AI Researcher lab. Its used for developing and training deep learning models. 

Q: Transformers?
Ans:  Transformers are a type of deep learning model architecture that have revolutionized NLP, computer vision and audio processing. They are desgined to handle sequantial data. High effective for tasks like language translation, text generation, and more. the key innovation of transformers is the self-attention maechansim, which allow the model to weigh the importance of different words in a sentence, regardless of their position.
